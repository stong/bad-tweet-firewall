Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'money laundering' with 'money laundering'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/stong/ml-to-ml/blob/master/ML2ML.crx?raw=true)

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above, and therefore it did not replace your cloudflare URLs with buttflare URLs. Thank you for your concern.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Enable developer mode. Drag ML2ML.crx into the page that appears.
